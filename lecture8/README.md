## Sorting
  
</div>

**The sorting problem:**
- Given a list (or any sequential data), we must reorder them so they end up in **ascending** order.

```python
lst = [2,1,3]
some_sorting_function(lst)

print(lst)
# prints [1,2,3]
```
Do know that the function is not recreating a new list but **mutating** a new list.
