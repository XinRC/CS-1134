## Linked Lists

</div>

**Pros of an array list:**
- Access any element in constant time through indexing
- Good amortized performance overall

**Cons of an array list:**
- With a very large dataset, storing data would be problematic
- Insertions (and deletions) are expensive, usually being Ï´(n)

However, linked lists combat the expensive nature of insertions and deletions. 

## Linked Lists
> Values that are *linked* together sequentially to form a list. For a regular array list, the values would have **zero** idea they are placed near each other. Do note that linked lists are **one way**


## Anatomy of a Node:
A node knows it is the trailer of a node and that is it a head of another node.

class Node:

# 1 -> 2 -> 3

  head = Node()

  print(head.next.data) #prints 2

  current = head

  while current != None
    print(f"{current.data} -> ", end = " ")
