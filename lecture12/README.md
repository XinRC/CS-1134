| Terms | Definition |
| :---: | :--- |
| **Parent** | The node above another node. Also called "root-node" |
| **Child** | The node below another node | 
| **Siblings** | This is when two nodes have the same parent |
| **Internal Nodes** | Any node that is *not* the last node |
| **Leaf Nodes** | And end nodes |
| **Subtrees** | A smaller tree that is part of a bigger tree. For every subtree, it would have a different "root-node" spanning from its root-node to the leaf-node of its subtree | 
| **Edge** | The "lines" that connect each node. `(u,v)` is an edge if `u` is the parent of `v` | 
| **Path** | The path of a tree. Where p = (v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, ... v<sub>k</sub>) is a path where each 2 consecutive nodes form an edge
| **Length of Path** | The amount of "edges" in a path ( |p| = number of edges in p )
| **Ancestor** | Where in `(u,v)`, `u` is the ancestor of `v` if there is a path to `u` from `v` |
| **Descendent** | Where in `(u,v)`, `v` has the ancestor of `u` if there is a path from `u` to `v` |
| **Level** | Whenever there is a "break" or "edge", a "level" will be formed. Levels increase as we get deeper into the tree. | 
| **Height of the Tree** | The length of the longest path in the tree |

- *Full Binary Tree*: Each tree node can *only* have 0 or 2 children.
- *Complete Binary Tree*: Each parent *must* have 2 children - forcing every level to have the max possible amount of nodes.

If the amount of work done by a tree is constant, then technically it would be of Î¸(n) because of the amount of times `(n)` it traverses the tree.

## To Traverse a List

</div>

## Preorder
This method looks at the center, left, then right recursively.

</div>

## Postorder
This method looks at the left, right, then center recursively. If the node is a "center" (aka a parent), then we will skip it and go to the next left/right before finally stating the center. Pretty much it goes down the furtherest left path, if there is no more left path, then it will go to the right path, and if there is no more right path, then it will recount the center path. This means ultimately the last value would be the root-root value.

## Inorder
This method is how we would read in english, from left, center, then right. If the node is a "center (aka a parent), we must skip it and go to the leftmost value. Ultimately we will go down to the furthest left value, go up a level to the center value, then go to the right value.

</div>

## Breadth-First Order
This is the most common method - it is also not recursive. For this method, we must see each nodes with its specific levels. We will traverse from level 0 to level `n`. We get the values of each level from left to right (usually but it is not required to go from left to right).

## Tree Implementation

```python
class Node:
  def __init__(self, data, left = None, right = None): # left/right represents the children
    self.data = data

    self.left = left
    if left is not None:
      self.left.parent = self

    self.right = right
    if right is not None:
      self.right.parent = self

    self.parent = None
```

```python
class LinkedBinaryTree:
  class Node:
    def __init__(self, data, left = None, right = None): # left/right represents the children
      self.data = data
  
      self.left = left
      if left is not None:
        self.left.parent = self
  
      self.right = right
      if right is not None:
        self.right.parent = self
  
      self.parent = None

  def __init__(self, root = None):
    self.root = root
    self.size = self.count_nodes()

  def count_nodes(self):
    '''
    total nodes rooted at root = 1 + total left nodes + total right nodes (where recursion comes in)
    base case = root is None
    recursive element = split the left and right nodes and trust it will work
    '''

    def subtree_count(root):
      if root is None:
        return 0
      else:
        left_count = subtree_count(root.left) # gathers the count from the left
        right_count = subtree_count(root.right) # gathers the count from the right

        return 1 + left_count + right_count # adds 1 (because we must count the root too) with the left/right count

    return subtree_count(self.root)


  def sum(self):
    '''
    sum at root = root's value + sum at left + sum at right
    base case = root is None
    recursive element = split the left and right into nodes and trust it will work
    '''
    def subtree_sum(root):
      if root is None:
        return 0
      else:
        left_sum = subtree_sum(root.left) # gathers the left sums
        right_sum = subtree_sum(root.right) # gathers the right sums 

      return root.data + left_sum + right_sum # adds the root data with the data from the left/right sums

    return subtree_sum(self.root)
```
