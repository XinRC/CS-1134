## Iterators:
When working with Iterators/Generators, a few things need to be kept in mind:
>Iterable: An item that is able to be become an iterator. This includes lists and strings.
>Iterator: The object that will be iterated through. 

By using the following code, the programmer will be able to assign the list as an iterator:
```python
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]
lst_iterator = iter(lst)
```
