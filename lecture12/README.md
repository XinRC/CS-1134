## Terms and Definitions
<div align = "center"> 
  
| Terms | Definition |
| :---: | :--- |
| **Parent** | The node above another node. Also called "root-node" |
| **Child** | The node below another node | 
| **Siblings** | This is when two nodes have the same parent |
| **Internal Nodes** | Any node that is *not* the last node |
| **Leaf Nodes** | And end nodes |
| **Subtrees** | A smaller tree that is part of a bigger tree. For every subtree, it would have a different "root-node" spanning from its root-node to the leaf-node of its subtree | 
| **Edge** | The "lines" that connect each node. `(u,v)` is an edge if `u` is the parent of `v` | 
| **Path** | The path of a tree. Where p = (v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, ... v<sub>k</sub>) is a path where each 2 consecutive nodes form an edge
| **Length of Path** | The amount of "edges" in a path ( |p| = number of edges in p )
| **Ancestor** | Where in `(u,v)`, `u` is the ancestor of `v` if there is a path to `u` from `v` |
| **Descendent** | Where in `(u,v)`, `v` has the ancestor of `u` if there is a path from `u` to `v` |
| **Level** | Whenever there is a "break" or "edge", a "level" will be formed. Levels increase as we get deeper into the tree. | 
| **Height of the Tree** | The length of the longest path in the tree | 

</div>

## Types of Binary Trees
> **Full Binary Tree**: Each tree node can only have 0 or 2 children.

> **Complete Binary Tree**: Each parent *must* have 2 children for each level. This means every level must have the max possible amount of nodes.

(For each level of the tree, each parent must have 2 children until we arrive at the level of the leaf nodes)

## To Traverse a List
To traverse a list, it will cost a minimum of Î¸(n) due to us going through the list `n` amount of times. 

</div>

## Preorder
This method looks at the center, left, then right recursively. This means we will get the value of the "center" value first then continuously get the value of the left value (because if it splits up, the left value would be considered a "center") until we reach the leftmost value. Then we will take the right value, and if it is the "center", then it will take the left value until it reaches the leftmost value, then taking the right value.

</div>

## Postorder
This method looks at the left, right, then center recursively. If the node is a "center" (aka a parent), then we will skip it and go to the next left/right before finally stating the center. Pretty much it goes down the furtherest left path, if there is no more left path, then it will go to the right path, and if there is no more right path, then it will recount the center path. This means ultimately the last value would be the root-root value.

</div>

## Inorder
This method is how we would read in english, from left, center, then right. If the node is a "center (aka a parent), we must skip it and go to the leftmost value. Ultimately we will go down to the furthest left value, go up a level to the center value, then go to the right value.

</div>

## Breadth-First Order
This is the most common method - it is also not the only one in the list that is not recursive. For this method, we must recognize the levels each nodes reside on. We will traverse from level 0 to level `n`. We will then get the values of each level from left to right (usually it goes from left to right, it is not required though).

## \[EXTRA] Generating from other generators
This technique was used in the previous code. This is an explaination on how it works

```python
def gen_yield():
  yield 1
  yield 2
  yield 3

def gen_2():
  yield 0

  # how would we yield the numbers from the function gen_yield()? The following would technically work but it looks bulky
  '''
  for value in gen_vield():
    yield value
  '''

  # a one-line solution for the above situation
  yield from gen_one()

  yield 4
  yield 5

# 1 2 3 4 5 (space represents a new line)
```
