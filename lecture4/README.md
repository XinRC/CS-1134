## Asymptotic Analysis:

> Algorithms: A well defined computation procedure that describes how to transfer any given input to its desired output.
Such algorithms must have a **legal** input and provide a defined output.

 ### For the algorithm to work, it must do two things:
- It can terminate
- It produces the correct output
